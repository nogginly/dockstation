## At the very least :-)

You need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

## Get started using `ops`

If you have [`ops`](https://github.com/nickthecook/ops) [^2] then all you have to do is the following after you clone this repo.

```
ops up
source tmp/local-setup.sh
```

And you're ready to go with the defaults.  Run `docker ps` to verify.

> If you don't use [`ops`](https://github.com/nickthecook/ops), I recommend you give it a go. Otherwise, follow the manual steps below.

### Additions `ops` commands

| Command           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ops start`       | Start/resume the Dockstation VM                                                                               |
| `ops stop`        | Suspend the VM by saving it's state before shutting the VM down.                                              |
| `ops destroy`     | Destroy the Dockstation, deletes all the containers and images within. You can always `ops start`  a new one. |
| `ops reprovision` | If you want to change the port, you can use this to reconfigure the Dockstation.                              |

### Multiple Dockstations

`ops` supports multiples "environments" where you can configure each and then switch between them by using the `$environment` variable. This is typically used for switching between `dev` and `staging` and `production` environments; similarly, here, we can use it to run multiple and separate Dockstations to separate containers run for those environments.

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be used before deploying the VM to change the default configuration:

| Variable           | Default Value      | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPT_DOCKER_PORT`  | `2375`             | The guest docker port and the forwarded host port |
| `OPT_VM_IP`        | `192.168.56.81`    | The VM's host-accessible IP address               |
| `OPT_VM_MEM_MB`    | `2048`             | The amount of memory allocated to the VM          |
| `OPT_VM_HOSTNAME`  | `dockstation`      | The VM's host name                                |
| `OPT_VM_LOCALNAME` | `$OPT_VM_HOSTNAME` | The VM's local name that vagrant lists.           |

## Get started manually

### Dependencies

```sh
brew install virtualbox
brew install vagrant
brew install docker
brew install docker-compose
```

### Deploy

```sh
vagrant up
source tmp/local-setup.sh
```

The local config sets up `DOCKER_HOST` to point to the pre-configured IP and PORT for the VM and docker daemon running in it, respectively.

### Verify

Try running `docker ps` and you should see the following:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```
## Under the hood

The `Vagrantfile` uses the `bento/ubuntu-20.04` box via the Vagrant cloud public box repository.

## Contribution Policy

Dockstation is open to code contributions for bug fixes only. Features carry a long-term maintenance burden so they will not be accepted at this time. Please submit an issue if you have a feature you'd like to request.
